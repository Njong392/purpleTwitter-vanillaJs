# Purple twitter?
Yes. Purple twitter. This twitter clone is merely for the sake of learning, but I had so much fun building it. The project will advance as my tech stack grows, and I can't measure how much I've learnt so far with only this simple layout.

# Project Overview
<p>Below is a simple screenshot which is mainly still under construction. </p>

# Tech Stack
For this project, I used;
- HTML/CSS
- Tailwind CSS
As time goes on however, this will be updated with React. A database will be added in (far, far) future, and I'll get to working with APIs perhaps.
